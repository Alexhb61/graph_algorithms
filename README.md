attempts at optimal algorithms in graph theory
## Clique algorithms
These are of special note because max clique is NP-Hard.
Sometimes I make an algorithm and find out later it is wrong.

## Matching Algorithms
I studied matching algorithms in college, and have researched transplant matching algorithms as well.

## Transitive Closure Algorithms
Might overlap with MM algorithms things.
