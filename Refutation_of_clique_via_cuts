I'll keep my refutation of my short paper short:
Lemma 3.5 assumes that The cut Tree of a graph is a spanning tree in the sense that it is a subgraph.
THIS IS FALSE. 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07331
Characterizes the small amount of times this is true.
Thus the proof falls apart.

Is the independent set problem NP-complete when both the graph's maximum degree and the graph's cut tree's maximum degree are both bounded?
I don't know.
Is the counting version #P-complete under those same constraints?
I don't know.
Can I rewrite the algorithm to solve those problems under these constraints?
Maybe.
